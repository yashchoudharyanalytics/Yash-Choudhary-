👋 Hi, I’m Yash Choudhary
Data Analyst → GenAI Practitioner

SQL • Python • Power BI • Excel • LangChain
📍 Pune, India

I’m a Data Analyst with a growing focus on Generative AI, working at the intersection of data, business, and intelligent systems.

I primarily work with SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel to solve business problems through data. Recently, I’ve been extending this skill set to LLM-powered applications, building conversational agents and multi-agent systems using LangChain, with tools, memory, and orchestration.

I also bring hands-on business experience from launching and managing a clothing brand, which helps me approach analytics with a strong business-first mindset.
